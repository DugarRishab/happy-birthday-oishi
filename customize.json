  "outroText": "I saw u for the 1st time in Junior Machine lab on our`1st exp. we were in the same group and as usual u couldn't do anything (because tor matha neyi). I didn't knew u back then, we were strangers so I never talked with u. But now that I know you, I know you are even more stupid than I thought (because u think 500 days of summer is a boring movie).I miss the days when we used to sit in class together and all I did was take bad pics of you to annoy you. (kal theke amar sathe bosbi, chagol). I miss the days when we used to share lunch in the small classroom. I miss the day when you used to run after me in machine lab. I miss the days when we could spend the entire break together doing stupid things. Anyway .. Last few weeks have been my happiest and everyday I look forward to our night walks together (I will come on time from next day). I first kissed you when we were both drunk and tbh that was the best decision I made. I will always regret rejecting you before knowing I could have been with you for more than a year. ",
